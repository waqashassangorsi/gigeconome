           GigeconoMe… no it’s not the surname of the new Italian striker who has joined the premier league    
          </h3>
          <p class="paragraph1">
            It is a play on words because even today, gig workers and the gig economy are subject to a lot of bias & misunderstanding due to the association with lower-skilled workers. But at GigeconoMe, our mission is to lead the shift from traditional work structures towards a full-time gig culture, where professional freelancers are integral to your business’ future success.

             ‘A near-death experience made me realise there is more to life’
          </h3>
          
          <p class="paragraph1">
            In 2018, I was in a car crash which saw me airlifted to hospital where I was told I should have died. I broke my back in three places, had a life-threatening twisted oesophagus and those are just the headline injuries. My recovery took almost a year-and-a-half and it was a moment which changed my life – and thankfully my outlook on life – forever.
Like many of you, I have always worked hard. And the rewards of that work have been tangible. By my early 30s, I was a director at an emerging recruitment business, I had just upgraded to a bigger house with my expanding family and on the surface, things were going extremely well for me. But that life-changing accident woke me up. I had been spending more time commuting than playing with my children. I was working 12-hour days constantly. And crucially, I was missing my children growing up. 
The accident changed my outlook on life completely and it was the catalyst for the birth of GigeconoMe.

            Freelancers and why the time is now.
          </h3>
          
          <p class="paragraph1">
              I suspect the majority of you are smarter than I am in not needing a major accident to realise there is more to life than just work! And we are now in an age where we have the technology to strike that perfect work-life balance we are all striving for. The days where the masses work tirelessly for a major corporation and strive to climb the ladder so they can enjoy the bumper pension in later life are gone – well for most of us any way. We want to live our best lives here and now.

            Whether it is the kick-ass working mums looking for flexibility, the dads hoping to do the school run or the desire to have a job which allows you to travel the world...whatever your reason, the benefits of freelancing are there for all to see. But with such a crowded market, the toughest challenge is getting your work and most importantly your talent in front of the people with the cash, and that is where we come in.

            <p class="paragraph1">
          GigeconoMe brings highly-skilled freelancers and businesses of all sizes together. You don’t need to be a full-time member of staff to transform a business and increasingly more companies are starting to realise that.<a href="<?php echo base_url()?>Newsignup">Take back control of your working life today

           Why businesses can’t afford to avoid the freelance market any more
          </h3>
          
            <p class="paragraph1">
              Businesses having to focus on their costs and structure is hardly new – it is an issue as old as business itself. But the Covid pandemic has certainly placed increasing scrutiny on businesses’ ongoing costs and the level of their staffing as we live through unprecedented times. Regardless of whether your company is in decline or if you are ready to embark on a major expansion project, freelancers are the solution. 
          </p>
          
            <p class="paragraph1">
             One of the few positives to come out of the nightmare 2020 we have all had to endure (and things aren’t much better at the start of 2021 are they?) is the realisation that remote working is a viable, long-term option and having all your staff in the same office, at all times, is no longer needed – although I’m sure you are all missing your daily updates from Edith in accounts about her pet cat who she affectionately refers to as ‘my daughter’.
          </p>
          
            <p class="paragraph1">
            In 2020 it was reported that more than one-third of the American workforce freelanced during the Covid pandemic, contributing $1.2 trillion to the US economy – a 22% increase since 2019. And as much as we like to think us in the UK do not follow a country whose previous leader suggested injecting bleach might be a good idea, when it comes to workforce trends, historically our friends in the USA have been ahead of us in Europe and the UK.
          </p>
          
          
            <p class="paragraph1">
          There are multiple benefits for businesses relying on freelance workers, including:
             
              <ul class="benefits_ul">
                 <li>Increases (or decreases for that matter) in supply and demand can be met with remarkable speed and efficiency. Project deployment can go from months to a matter of days.</li>
                  <li>Companies are finding it hard to source local talent quickly and at an affordable cost, whereas freelancers can be sourced from anywhere across the globe.</li>
                  <li>It’s cheaper and easier to deal with an individual rather than an expensive agency and their overhead costs.</li>
                  <li>Millennials are increasingly looking to the freelance and project-based marketplace for work due to the obvious benefits.</li>
                  <li>And one of the most obvious: you often don’t need certain skillsets for 12 months of the year so why would you want to pay them for every week, including annual leave?</li>
             </ul>
             
               <p class="paragraph1">
                    When you really think about it, the benefits of having full-time staff are far outweighed by those of building a reliable network of freelancers. At GigeconoMe, our freelance community is made up of remote-based, highly-skilled, driven self-starters who want to network, constantly increase their skillsets, and want to expose themselves to new opportunities.<a href="<?php echo base_url()?>Newsignup">So what are you waiting for?</a>

              But how does GigeconoMe work?
            </h3>
             <ul class="benefits_ul">
                 <li>Whether you are a freelancer or a business, GigeconoMe is free to join.</li>
                  <li>You can set up a profile in a matter of minutes and start looking for new projects within the hour.</li>
                  <li>Businesses are able to search by sector and look at individual freelancers’ profiles to see examples of their work and projected costing.</li>
                  <li>Freelancers and businesses agree on a statement of work by which the finished work shall be assessed.</li>
                  <li>When work has been completed, the funds are released and GigeconoMe receives a small percentage.</li>
                  <li>Businesses have the chance to start small by inserting an individual freelancer into a project alongside existing staff, before expanding their network of reliable and trusted freelancers over time.</li>
                  <li>Many businesses, including major corporations, now rely on ‘talent clouds’, where a host of freelancers have already been pre-vetted and onboarded ready for when they are needed. We can help you achieve this.</li>
